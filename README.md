# MultiUserChat

This is a multiuser chat that i made for practising python sockets, threads and GUI with tkinter. 
It is work in progress. I will add ciphered messages to prevent mitm an many other features like 
add message when someone leaves chat (and many more).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use
You choose your username (and in the future there will be a login with user/password) and then a
window shows, where you can start chatting.

  - When a user log in, a message will be shown.
  - When you send a message (write and press <Enter>), everyone on the chat will be able to see it.
